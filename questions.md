#Questions

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

    I have spent around 10 hours in total, excluding the brainstorming. About 8 hours to get the scenarios to work, then another 2 hours for refactoring and answering the questions.
    I tried to make my solution cover the scenarios you have given me, then some more I have thought of. It has been quite a tricky task, pleasantly challenging. 
    The solution I have come up with, might not be the most optimal one, this is what I was able to come up with in the amount of time I had.
    I tried to keep the code as clean as I could, but I am sure there is room for better.
    
    
2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?

    I am using PHP for more than 4 years. Back in my early days of web development. I believe the large community behind, is what got me started. Later on I landed on an internship which introduced me to a PHP MVC Framework called Kohana. Now I use PHP because this is what I am most comfortable with. But I am leaving the door open for other languages in the future.
    
3. What is your favourite thing about Laravel? 

    When I first started using Laravel, I loved the concept of migrations and seeders. Now I just enjoy how easy Laravel makes your life. Also it has a big community to help you out.
    
4. What is your least favourite?

    This is more of a general issue that you find over in most of the frameworks. They come with a lot of stuff you do not need. If you choose to optimize the framework for your situation, you will find yourself later in a situation where you can no longer upgrade the versions, as you have modified the base code of the framework. Leaving you with legacy code.
    
5. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

    I have not faced such issues on live websites, only on internal systems. Nothing too fancy. It's usually been colleagues that would notify me that the system would be slow in certain situations. I would go ahead and test it myself. I learnt to troubleshoot an application from the front-end up to back-end, database, server performance, even internet connection / bandwidth usage. Many times I would only have to optimize mysql queries that would in some cases take too long to execute.
